It introduces Python API commands\nfor authentication using API key and prompt inferencing using WML API.\n\n**Note:** Notebook code generated using Prompt Lab will execute successfully.\nIf code is modified or reordered, there is no guarantee it will successfully execute.\nFor details, see: <a href=\"/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-prompt-save.html?context=wx\" target=\"_blank\">Saving your work in Prompt Lab as a notebook.</a>\n\nSome familiarity with Python is helpful.

Their lack of expertise was evident and hindered the learning process. I felt the instructor didn\u2019t add much value to the session.\n\n2.The training sessions were monotonous and lacked engagement. There were no interactive elements to keep us involved, making it difficult to stay focused. It felt like we were just being talked at for hours.\n\n3.The presentation was rushed and hard to follow. The instructor moved too quickly through important points without ensuring we understood. This left many of us confused and unable to keep up.\nOutput: Provide additional training for instructors to enhance their subject matter expertise and teaching skills. Incorporate interactive elements such as Q&A sessions and hands-on activities to keep participants engaged and ensure a manageable pace with regular checks for\u00a0understanding.\n\nInput: 1. The instructor's explanations were too technical and difficult to understand. They didn't simplify the concepts for beginners.\n\n2. There was no opportunity for us to apply what we learned through practical exercises. The training was too theoretical.\n\n3. The sessions were too long without any breaks, making it hard to maintain concentration and absorb the information.\n\nOutput: Introduce a more balanced training approach by simplifying technical explanations, incorporating practical exercises to apply learned concepts, and scheduling regular breaks to help maintain focus and improve information\u00a0retention.\n\nInput: 1. Our team meetings often lack diverse perspectives, as some employees are hesitant to share their ideas due to fear of judgment.\n2. There is a noticeable lack of representation in leadership positions, which makes it hard for underrepresented groups to feel motivated and included.\n3. Despite having diversity policies, there is little follow-through, and many employees feel that their concerns about inclusion are not being taken seriously.\n\n\nOutput: Implement a comprehensive inclusion initiative that encourages open dialogue by creating safe spaces for sharing ideas, establishes mentorship programs to support diverse talent in leadership roles, and ensures accountability by regularly reviewing and acting on feedback related to inclusion\u00a0concerns.\n\nInput: 1. The expectation to be available outside of regular working hours is affecting my personal time and causing burnout.\n\n2. There is no clear boundary between work and personal life, especially with remote work. It feels like I'm always on the clock.\n\n3. The workload is overwhelming, and there is little support or flexibility from management to manage personal responsibilities.\n\nOutput:\"\"\"\n", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Execution\nLet us now use the defined Model object and pair it with input and\ngenerate the response:\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "print(\"Submitting generation request...\")\ngenerated_response = model.generate_text(prompt=prompt_input, guardrails=True)\nprint(generated_response)\n", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Next steps\nYou successfully completed this notebook!
